<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About Me</h3>

My name is <b>Hyunho Lee</b> and I am a <b>Senior Manager at K-water</b> (Korea Water Resources Corporation). 
<!-- Prior to joining Google, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Southern California under the supervision of Professor Yan Liu. 
I also spent time at the NYU Center for Data Science to collaborate with Professor Kyunghyun Cho. -->

I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, my research mainly focuses on principled techniques for extracting knowledge from the complex structures or networks and using it to build predictive models â€“ in that way merging insights both from data mining and machine learning. I am working on the following topics:
<!--Furthermore, combining the structural knowledge with temporal behaviors is the topic which I am interested in. --> 

Physics-guided machine learning
Spatiotemporal data mining
Uncertainty Estimation
