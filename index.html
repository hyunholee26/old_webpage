<h3 class="archive__subtitle">About Me</h3>

My name is <b>Hyunho Lee</b> and I am a <b>Senior Manager at K-water</b> (Korea Water Resources Corporation). <br><br>

<!-- Prior to joining Google, I was a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department of University of Southern California under the supervision of Professor Yan Liu. 
I also spent time at the NYU Center for Data Science to collaborate with Professor Kyunghyun Cho. -->

I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, my research focuses on incorporating prior knowledge (especially physics-based knowledge) within data-driven models or learning process as an inductive bias, thereby achieving efficient learning from few samples or sparse observations. Also, I would like to research the applications of these techniques in water resources management such as the prediction of water level and dam inflow. My main research interests are below:

<!--Furthermore, combining the structural knowledge with temporal behaviors is the topic which I am interested in. 
I am interested in machine learning problems in general. More specifically, my research mainly focuses on principled 
techniques for extracting knowledge from the complex structures or networks and using it to build predictive models â€“ 
in that way merging insights both from data mining and machine learning. -->
