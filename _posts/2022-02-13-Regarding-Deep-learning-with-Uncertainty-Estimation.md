I will summarize serveral articles regarding deep learning with uncertainty estimation. Providing confidence intervals in regression problems is related to uncertainty estimation. A phrase that can express this well is quoted as follows.

> We do a lot of regression, with everything from random forests to recurrent neural networks. And as good as our models are, we know they can never be perfect. Therefore, whenever we provide our customers with predictions, we also like to include a set of confidence intervals: what range around the prediction will the actual value fall within, with (e.g.) 80% confidence?

 - This article give the example code related to generate distribution of predicted value with cumstomed layer and loss function.
