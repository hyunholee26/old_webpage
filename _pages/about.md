Hello! This is **Hyunho Lee**. I am a **senior manager at K-water** (Korea Water Resources Corporation)
<!-- first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota and a member of Knowledge Computing Lab, advised by Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang. -->

My research focuses on **incorporating prior knowledge (especially physics-based knowledge) within data-driven models or learning process as an inductive bias, thereby achieving efficient learning from few samples or sparse observations and making the model easier to understand for scientists and non-machine-learning experts.** Also, I would like to research the applications of these techniques in water resources management such as the prediction of water level and dam inflow. 

I obtained my Master's degree in **Computer Science from KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)** under Prof. Kwangyun, Wohn's supervision. Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in **Information and Computer Engineering from Ajou University**.

For more information about my research experience, please refer to my **Curriculum Vitae** (PDF).
